When only the first occurence of the pattern should be found we can further 
split the text into more tiny chunks of two, four or eight times the size of the 
pattern. Of course these little chunks must overlap at least with the length of 
the pattern. 

Each process would only search in one of those tiny chunks for the pattern.
After a process has finished his chunk he sends a "done" message to the master.
If the process has found a occurence of the pattern he send the location to the
master. Each process then waits for the master to send him the next chunk. The
master does so if he receives no "found" message from any of the processes. If
he received a "found" message, he informs the other worker processes that the 
occurence was found and terminates them.

This scheme allows us to only do the work necessary. If one of the processes 
finds the pattern in his first chunk, the rest of the text has not to be
searched. Also only the really needed parts of the text are send to the worker 
processes, therefor the communication is minized.
